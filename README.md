# 42 Cursus
Hub of repositories (represented as git submodules inside each corresponding folder) that contains exercises from exercises presented at 42 cursus.
Each folder contains:
- README that contains a simple description of the project. *NOTE: This is not the exercise subject, please check project subject on 42 intra.*
- Folder called `files` that contains the git submodule of the exercise. Only files inside this folder should be pushed to 42 intra project repository.
- File `test.c` that contains tests for the project. This test file will be used by GitHub actions to validate each project.
